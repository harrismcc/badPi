# badPi
A really dumb way of calculating pi

## Overview
simply speaking, badPi is a very interesting, but very ineffective way of calculating digits of pi. It works by simulating two masses in a 2d space in which there is no friction and each object has perfect elasticity (aka no energy is lost). Additionally it has a wall at x=0 where the objects can collide. By sending the objects at each other and counting the total number of collisions we can find digits of pi! Exciting!
